## What it does
### Our application detects food that you eat using the Tensorflow object detection API and displays statistics about how much effect what you're eating has on the planet in order to spread awareness about the effects of producing food. Additionally, we have a backup system in which instead of scanning food, you put in the barcode of the

## How we built it
### We built this using the Tensorflow object detection API, web scraping in python with beautiful soup, data analysis in R, and a website with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
## Challenges we ran into
### There were many times when we had git commit issues.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
### Training the AI, analyzing data, web scraping, and making the website.
## What we learned
### VS Code Live Share and Live Server is very good for working on the same code at the same time and watching live changes on localhost for web dev.
## What's next for Carbon Footprint Awareness AI App
### The big picture is to expand our project to assess the carbon emissions in all places around the globe. Once people can understand the extent of the environmental damage they are doing, they can take action to aid it. To expand our project, we could streamline it for companies and add more data to make our neural network even better. A big portion of the money we receive will go towards social marketing and getting our product maximum outreach in our community and beyond.
